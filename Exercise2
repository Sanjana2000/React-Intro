Exercise2:
In your own words,
describe React's core concept of uni-directional data flow.
Draw diagrams to illustrate.

In uni-directional data flow, the information flows in only one direction,
and is when the information is displayed, but not updated.
It is used to bind the data from the model to view without updating the HTML
template or view automatically.So custom code is needed to accomplish it.

Whereas Two-way data binding is used to bind the data from the model to
view and vice versa by automatically updating the HTML
template without writing any custom code.

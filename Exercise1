SPA: A single-page application is a web application or web site that
interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather
than loading entire new pages from a server.This can dramatically improve the
speed and overall flow of a user experience.After the application loads, usually only
small amounts of data are sent back and forth between the browser and server instead
of full pages. This usually results in better performance and doesn't use as much
bandwidth. Also, different portions of the application can be updated dynamically
without having to reload the entire page. In addition to less bandwidth, this also means
less load on the browser and server.



Progessive web app:

 A PWA lets you install the application from the browser window itself,
  is available on your phone like a native app.
 PWA works offline, just like a native app.When you open this app,
 you will be able to browse the content even when you do not
  have internet. You have offline access to the app.

  1. It is Fast: PWAs provide experiences that are consistently fast.
From the moment a user downloads an app to the moment they start interacting with it,
everything happens really fast because you can cache the data, it is extremely fast to
start the app again even without hitting the network.

2. Integrated user experience: PWAs feel and behave like native apps. They sit in
a user’s home screen, send push notifications like native apps, and have access to a
device’s functionalities like native apps. The experience feels seamless and integrated.

3. Reliable experience: With the help of service workers, we can reliably paint a picture
on a user’s screen even when network has failed.
Engaging: Because we can send notifications to a user, we can really drive the
engagement up by keeping the user notified and engaged with the app.

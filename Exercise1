In your own words, explain React's Virtual DOM.
What gives React its fast performance?


Virtual DOM:
 It is a virtual layer between template and DOM.
it's an in-memory representation of the actual elements that are being
created on page.



React's fast performance:

The browser holds a Virtual representation of the UI in memory, and React
whenever there is a change in the state of a component, re-renders only the
portions of the DOM that needs to be updated. It makes changes to a minimal amount
of real DOM nodes.
Then changes in the DOM are preprocessed in the Virtual Dom.
  After that there is a sync process that computes the elements in the Real DOM
  that needs to be updated.

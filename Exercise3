Benefits of React:

1.React uses a virtual DOM.The virtual DOM is a representation
 mapped to a real DOM that tracks changes and updates only specific
 elements without affecting the other parts of the whole tree.
2.React uses JavaScript, a dynamically-typed language
 which means we don’t have to define the variable’s type.


Benefits of Angular:
1.Angular is a front-end framework powered by Google
 and is compatible with most of the common code editors.
2.Angular framework allows developers to create dynamic,
single-page web applications (SPAs).
3.Angular uses two-way binding. If we change the UI element (a user input) in Angular,
then the corresponding model state changes as well.
 Additionally, if we change the model state, then the UI element changes –
 hence, two-way data binding.
